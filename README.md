# BioLearn 2025 – Competition Deliverables

Submissions by **Leoncini** for the **BioLearn Fall 2025 Competition** (Harvard Aging Initiative × BioLearn).  
Each deliverable is organized in its own folder (`Comp1/`, `Comp2/`, etc.), including the analysis code, a short write-up, and any generated figures.

## Contents
- **[Comp1](./Comp1/)** – Apply and Interpret Biolearn Functions  
  - `analysis.ipynb`: main notebook with code and visualizations  
  - `writeup.pdf`: brief explanation of methods, results, and interpretation  

Additional competition deliverables will be added in separate subfolders as the program progresses.

## Notes
- All code is written in Python and uses the [BioLearn](https://bio-learn.github.io/auto_examples/index.html) package.  
- Each deliverable folder is self-contained for easy review.  
- Repo is currently **public for BioLearn submission**. Visibility may change after review.
